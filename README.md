## Empathize

*If you implement the scenario, who would be your customers?*

> We are going to build a Data-as-Service platform to help Companies or Users to minit the condition of teaching buildings (e.g. environment, the number of people). And we provide some APIs to help them get data.

## Define

*What do your users need?*

> They should provide which building and when they are interested. And then we can estimate the number of people from Wi-Fi dataset[1]. Still, we can use some scripts to visit some APIs of other companies to get data related to the weather, the number of shared bicycles near this building.

## Ideate

* Scenario: The monitor system of teaching buildings on Campus

* Possible solutions: Web services & APIs. We can also provide some methods to help the administrator to decide how many rooms.

* Key involved stakeholders: The administrator of teaching building, students, some companies (e.g. ofo, because our platform can help them plan how to put bicycles)

* Key metrics for evaluating: The feedback from the students/administrator.

* Similar or related scenarios: 

## Prototype

How you would do the prototype of your scenario?

> Web Services.
> APIs.

## Test

*How would you test and demonstrate the prototype of your scenario?*

> 1.Give questionnaires to users,ask for their feedback.
> 2.Use monitoring or send people to count the number specialty.
> 3.Use code for performing automated testing.
